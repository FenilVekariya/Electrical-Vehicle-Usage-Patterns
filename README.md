# Electrical-Vehicle-Usage-Patterns

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging patterns using Python and various data visualization techniques. The objective is to explore charging behavior trends, understand utilization rates, and identify patterns that could help optimize the use of EV charging stations.

**Features**

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualization of key metrics such as charging duration, start time, and energy consumption

- Identification of peak usage periods and trends

- Analysis of geographical distribution of charging sessions


**Technologies Used**

- Python

- Pandas for data manipulation

- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

**How to Run**

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the analysis
  
2. Review the visualizations and insights provided throughout the notebook
  
**Data Source**

The dataset for EV charging patterns is used for the analysis and is preprocessed for better insights.
